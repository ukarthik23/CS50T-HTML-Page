This is a project I have made for a CS50-T Assignment on Web Development.
It's a simple website on Top 5 Universities in the USA for Computer Science.
For each of the 5 universities, there is a seperate home page for the details about their Computer Sceince Program.
All the styling for all the pages are included in 'style.css'
